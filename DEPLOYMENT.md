## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com) and sign in

7. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
8. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Push to GitHub

After creating the repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Navigate to your project directory
cd /Users/andreferreira/Desktop/Dev/techtree/nodes_organigram

# Add the remote repository (replace YOUR-USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/interactive-organigram.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Deploy to Render.com

1. Go to [Render.com](https://render.com) and sign up/sign in
2. Click "New +" and select "Web Service"
3. Connect your GitHub account if not already connected
4. Select your `interactive-organigram` repository
5. Configure the deployment:
   - **Name**: `interactive-organigram`
   - **Environment**: `Node`
   - **Build Command**: `npm install`
   - **Start Command**: `npm start`
